# Classic Snake Game

A simple and fun implementation of the classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and try to achieve the highest score! High scores are saved locally in your browser.

## Features:

* **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control a snake to eat food and grow.
* **Score Tracking:** Your current score is displayed during the game.
* **High Score:** The highest score achieved is saved in the browser's local storage and displayed.
* **Keyboard Controls:** Use arrow keys (or WASD) to direct the snake.
* **Responsive Design:** The game layout adapts to different screen sizes (within reasonable limits for a grid-based game).
* **Simple & Clean UI:** Easy to understand and play.
* **Game Over & Restart:** Clear indication of game over with an option to play again.

## Technologies Used:

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the game.
* **CSS3:** For styling the game elements and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the game logic, controls, and interactions.
* **Local Storage:** For persisting the high score.

## How to Play:

1.  **Start the Game:** Click the "Start Game" button.
2.  **Control the Snake:**
    * Use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to change the snake's direction.
    * Alternatively, you can use **W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), D (Right)** keys.
3.  **Eat Food:** Guide the snake to the red food blocks. Each piece of food eaten will increase your score and the snake's length.
4.  **Avoid Collisions:**
    * Do not let the snake run into the walls of the game area.
    * Do not let the snake run into its own body.
5.  **Game Over:** If you collide with a wall or the snake's own tail, the game will end. Your final score will be recorded, and the high score will be updated if you've surpassed it.
6.  **Play Again:** Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

## Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

* **Obstacles:** Add static or moving obstacles on the game board.
* **Pause Functionality:** Allow players to pause and resume the game.
* **Mobile Touch Controls:** Implement swipe gestures for playing on touch devices.
* **Improved Visuals/Themes:** Offer different visual themes or more polished graphics.
